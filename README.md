# Circle-on-the-Farthest-Points
In this program, the user is asked to enter 10 points with the mouse using the while loop. Based on the 
coordinates of these points, their distance between points is found using the distance method. Then the index 
of the two points with the furthest distance is found using the nested loop. Using this index, the color of the 
two points changes to blue. A circle is then drawn so that this distance is the diameter of the circle.
